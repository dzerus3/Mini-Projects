# Abandon all hope, ye who enter here
This is my zshrc, a script I bootlegged to control mpd remotely without dependencies, and an ansible playbook I tried to use to make setting up new computers easier. zshrc depends on oh-my-zsh. Do not use; I'm only keeping this repo around for archival reasons.
